# text-classification
This repository includes work for text classification with transformers. 

The work is organised in an ipynb format which can be run as a Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab. 
Recommended usage is Google Colab, as this allows to use a GPU in the runtime, significantly increasing the training time of the model.

Methods for adding accuracy for each category and for the whole model should be added still. Visualisation of the training should be done as well, preferably in a line chart for the accuracy of the training epochs to see the training process. Also, visualisation of the results could be done with a confusion matrix with colours. Evaluation of the model shouldn't be based on these metrics solemnly, but also on some qualitative analysis of some samples of each category.
